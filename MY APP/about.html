                <h3>What is Image Caption Generation?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p>Image Caption Generation is the process of generating textual descriptions for images. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to understand the content of an image and describe it in human-readable language.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p>Our Image Caption Generation project uses advanced machine learning models, specifically designed for computer vision tasks. The process involves the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Image Feature Extraction: The model extracts relevant features from the input image using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</li>
                    <li>Sequence Generation: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models are then used to generate a sequence of words based on the extracted features.</li>
                    <li>Language Modeling: The generated sequence is refined using language models to ensure coherence and grammatical correctness.</li>
                </ol>
