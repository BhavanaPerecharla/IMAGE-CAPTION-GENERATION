# IMAGE-CAPTION-GENERATION
Image Caption Generation using Deep Learning

Project Title: Image Caption Generation
About the Project
This project focuses on building an Image Caption Generation system that automatically generates textual descriptions for images. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction, this project aims to create meaningful and contextually accurate captions for a wide variety of images.

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between visual content and natural language, making images more accessible and understandable to machines and people alike.

Key Features
Automated Image Captioning: Generates descriptive captions for any input image.
Deep Learning Approach: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as CNNs and RNNs, for feature extraction and language modeling.
Pre-trained Models: Incorporates pre-trained models like VGG16, InceptionV3, or ResNet for efficient feature extraction.
Data Augmentation: Employs data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
End-to-End Pipeline: Provides a comprehensive pipeline from image preprocessing to caption generation.

How It Works
Image Feature Extraction: The CNN model processes an input image and extracts visual features.
Sequence Generation: The extracted image features are fed into the LSTM, which generates a caption by predicting the next word in the sequence.
Word Prediction: The process continues until the model generates a complete caption.

Workflow
Input: An image is fed into the system.
Feature Extraction: A CNN, such as ResNet or Inception, extracts the relevant visual features from the image.
Caption Generation: The extracted features are passed to the LSTM-based decoder to generate a coherent sequence of words describing the image.
Output: A natural language caption describing the image is produced.

Getting Started:
To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or above
TensorFlow or PyTorch (Choose your preferred framework)
NumPy
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
Other libraries mentioned in requirements.txt


Project Setup
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/BhavanaPerecharla/image-caption-generation.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd image-caption-generation
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Model : After installation, you can run the model locally:

Training the Model:
You can train the model using a dataset like MSCOCO ,Flick8k or any custom dataset. Adjust the parameters in train.py as per your requirement:
python train.py

Generating Captions:
Once the model is trained, you can generate captions for new images:
python caption_generator.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg


Model Architecture
The image caption generation system uses a combination of CNN and RNN to generate captions:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Pre-trained models such as InceptionV3 or ResNet are used to extract visual features from the input image.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): The extracted features are passed to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which generates the caption.



Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset that includes both images and their corresponding captions. Some common datasets used for image caption generation include:

MSCOCO Dataset: A large-scale dataset that contains over 300,000 images and five captions per image. Explore MSCOCO here
You can also use any custom dataset, which must include:

Images
Captions in .csv or .json format
Data Preprocessing
The images are resized and normalized to match the input requirements of the CNN model. Captions are tokenized, padded, and encoded for input to the LSTM model.

Results
The trained model generates descriptive captions with a good level of accuracy. Here are some examples of the generated captions:

Example 1:
Generated Caption: "A group of people riding horses on a beach"

Example 2:
Generated Caption: "A dog sitting on a couch with a remote control"

Example 3:
Generated Caption: "A man holding an umbrella in a rainy street"
